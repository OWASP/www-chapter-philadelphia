Hi and Welcome to the Philadelphia chapter homepage! 

We are working to foster an open and accessible community of security practitioners of all types. EVERYONE is welcome to attend our meetings as we work together to raise the security awareness and skill sets of all attendees through an open exchange of information. Come join us!

We are still charting our course! Come lend a hand! We are doing monthly meetings that will be alternating between Speakers and our own TBD OWASP Project. Please <a href="mailto:higgs.json@owasp.org">email Matt</a> if you are interested in speaking, would like to support a role, or have any questions! See you soon.
