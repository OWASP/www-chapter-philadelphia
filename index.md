Hi and Welcome to the Philadelphia chapter homepage! 

We are working to foster an open and accessible community of security practitioners of all types. EVERYONE is welcome to attend our meetings as we work together to raise the security awareness and skill sets of all attendees through an open exchange of information. Come join us!

Our first meeting will be in January of 2024 - please <a href="mailto:higgs.json@owasp.org">email Matt</a> if you are interested in speaking or have any questions! See you soon.

It's here! Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 23, 2024 at the Black Sheep Pub in Center City Philadelphia.

We'll talk a bit of shop about OWASP, do some introductions, discuss any project ideas, and talk about what people want to see in a Philly based Application Security group.
